Lesson 6: API Fundamentals - Homework Assignment
================================================

Objective: Build a Bored Activity CLI App
-----------------------------------------

Create a command-line menu application that helps users find activities when they're bored!

This homework combines:

-   GET requests with different parameters

-   CLI menu system with user input

-   Error handling

-   Working with query parameters

* * * * *

Instructions
------------

1.  Create a Python file called homework.py

2.  Build a CLI menu that lets users choose different options

3.  Use the Bored API to get activity suggestions

4.  Handle user input and make appropriate API requests

5.  Test your menu system thoroughly

* * * * *

API You'll Use
--------------

-   Bored API: https://bored-api.appbrewery.com

* * * * *

Your CLI Menu
-------------

Create a menu system that looks like this:
```python
Bored  Activity  Finder
=====================
1.  Get  a  random  activity
2.  Get  activity  by  type  
3.  Get  activity  by  participants
4.  Save  my  favorite  activities
5.  View  my  saved  activities
6.  Exit
Choose  an  option  (1-6): 
```
* * * * *

Required Functions
------------------

### Function 1: Get Random Activity

```python
def  get_random_activity():
    """
    Get a completely random activity suggestion
    API: https://bored-api.appbrewery.com/random
    """
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    # 1. Make a GET request to the API
    # 2. Parse the JSON response  
    # 3. Print the activity and type nicely
    # 4. Handle any errors
    pass
```

### Function 2: Get Activity by Type

```python
def  get_activity_by_type():
    """
    Let user choose an activity type and get a suggestion
    API: https://bored-api.appbrewery.com/filter?type={type}
    Types: education, recreational, social, diy, charity, cooking, relaxation, music, busywork
    """
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    # 1. Show the user available types
    # 2. Get their choice
    # 3. Make API request with type parameter
    # 4. Display the result
    pass
```

### Hint: This one requires query parameters

### Function 3: Get Activity by Participants

```python
def  get_activity_by_participants():
    """
    Get activity suggestions based on number of participants
    API: https://bored-api.appbrewery.com/filter?participants={number}
    """
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    # 1. Ask user how many participants
    # 2. Make API request with participants parameter
    # 3. Display the activity suggestion
    pass
```

### Hint: This one requires query parameters

###

Bonus
-----

### Function 5: Save Favorite Activity

```python
def  save_favorite_activity():
    """
    Get an activity and save it to a text file
    """
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    # 1. after getting an activity from one of the other functions
    # 2. Ask user if they want to save it
    # 3. If yes, append to 'favorite_activities' list
    # 4. Print "Activity Saved"
    pass
```

### Function 6: View Saved Activities

```python
def  view_saved_activities():
    """
    Read and display saved activities from file
    """
    # YOUR CODE HERE
    # Loop through the list of saved activities and display each one
    pass
```

* * * * *

Main Function & Menu System
---------------------------

Create your main function with a loop that keeps showing the menu:

```python
import  requests

def  show_menu():
    """Display the main menu"""
    print("\nBored Activity Finder")
    print("="  *  21)
    print("1. Get a random activity")
    print("2. Get activity by type")
    print("3. Get activity by participants")
    print("4.  Save  my  favorite  activities")
    print("5.  View  my  saved  activities")
    print("6.  Exit")

def  main():
    """Main function with menu loop"""
    print("Welcome to the Bored Activity Finder!")
    while  True:
        show_menu()
        try:
            choice  =  input("\nChoose an option (1-7): ")
            if  choice  ==  '1':
                get_random_activity()
            elif  choice  ==  '2':
                get_activity_by_type()
            elif  choice  ==  '3':
                get_activity_by_participants()
            elif  choice  ==  '4':
                save_favorite_activity()
            elif  choice  ==  '5':
                view_saved_activities()
            elif  choice  ==  '6':
                print("Thanks for using Bored Activity Finder!")
                break
            else:
                print("Invalid choice! Please choose 1-6.")
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print("\n\nGoodbye!")
            break

if  __name__  ==  "__main__":
    main()
```

Example Output
--------------

Here's what your program should look like when running:

```python
Welcome  to  the  Bored  Activity  Finder!

Bored  Activity  Finder
=====================
1.  Get  a  random  activity
2.  Get  activity  by  type
3.  Get  activity  by  participants
4.  Save  my  favorite  activities
5.  View  my  saved  activities
6.  Exit

Choose  an  option  (1-6):  1

Random  Activity  Suggestion:
Activity:  Learn  to  play  a  musical  instrument
Type:  Music
Participants:  1
Ready  to  try  it?
```

* * * * *

Hints for Success
-----------------

### API Response Format

The Bored API returns JSON like this:

```python
{
  "activity":  "Learn to play a musical instrument",
  "type":  "music",
  "participants":  1,
  "price":  0.1,
  "link":  "",
  "key":  "4526284",
  "accessibility":  "Few to no challenges"
}
```

* * * * *

### Test Your Program

Make sure to test:

-   All menu options work

-   Invalid menu choices are handled

-   API errors are handled gracefully

-   File saving and reading works

-   User can exit cleanly
